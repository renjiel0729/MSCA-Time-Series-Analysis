### Question 1:
Load the data and calculate the average cost of a night’s accommodation in Victoria each month (i.e.,
Cost variable).
a) Plot the CPI and Cost time series.
b) Plot the Cost time series against the CPI time series and calculate the correlation between CPI
and Cost.
Discuss your results and explain why the logarithms of both variables need to be taken before fitting any models.
c) Plot the 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑃𝐼) and 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡) time series and calculate the correlation between the
logarithms of both CPI and Cost.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(fpp)
library(TSA)
library(forecast)
```

```{r}
load('motel.rda')
cost <- motel[,'Takings']*1000 / motel[,'Roomnights']
cpi <- motel[,'CPI']

data <- cbind(CPI = motel[,'CPI'] , Cost = motel[,'Takings']*1000 / motel[,'Roomnights'])

tsdisplay(cpi)
tsdisplay(cost)
```
Both cost and CPI have positive trend, and cost has possible seasonality. The variance for cost also appears to be increasing.
```{r}
plot(x = cpi, y = cost)
cor(cpi,cost)
```
From the plot we can see a very storng correlation. And from the correlation function, we see a very strong correlation 0.991, very close to 1.

```{r}
plot(x = log(cpi), y = log(cost))
cor(log(cpi),log(cost))
```
The plot of the log cpi and cost also shows a positive correlation. From the function we can see that there are still very strong correlation, 0.993 very close to 1. The log transformation for cpi and cost are needed because they are not in the same scale, and we need to make the variance for cost stay constant.

### Question 2:
Question 2:
a) Use the linear model with time series components function tslm() to fit a linear model to the
𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡) time series as a function of the 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑃𝐼) time series (i.e., CPI ➔ Independent
variable, Cost➔ Dependent variable).
```{r}
lm1 <- tslm(log(cost)~log(cpi))
lm1
```


b) Plot 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑃𝐼) against 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡) and the fitted trend.
```{r}
plot(x = log(cpi), y = log(cost), col = 1)
abline(lm1, col = 2)
legend('topleft', legend = c('actual' , 'Trend'), col = 1:2, lty = 1)
```

c) Use the summary() function to summarize the generated model , and the checkresiduals()
function to evaluate the residuals.
Discuss your results.
```{r}
summary(lm1)

checkresiduals(lm1)
```
The linear model has two variable, the intercept and the log(cpi) Both of theses two variables are significant because their p values is less than 0.05. The adjusted r-squared is 0.986, very close to 1 means that this model capture the linaer relationship in the data very well. 

The residuals from the tslm model does not look like white noise. There are many lags that are significant in the acf plot of the residuals. The p value is also smaller than 0.05 which rejects the null hypothesis that the residuals is a white noise. This means that the tslm model does not capture the trend very well for the dataset. 

### Question 3:
Use the auto.arima() function to fit an appropriate regression model with ARIMA errors to the Cost and
CPI time series(i.e., CPI ➔ Independent variable, Cost➔ Dependent variable). Set the Order of seasonaldifferencing
argument, D, to 1 and the ‘lambda’ argument to 0 to reflect a logarithmic transformation.
a) Use the summary() function to summarize the generated model.
```{r}
auto1 <- auto.arima(D = 1,lambda = 0, y = cost, xreg = cpi)
summary(auto1)
```

From the auto arima, the model is a seasonal model with 12 lags as the season. For the non seasonal part, we have a first order differencing moving average 1 model. For the seaosnal part, we have a first order differencing auto regression 1 and moving average 2 model. The model also has a xreg component the cpi. 

b) Use the checkresiduals() function to evaluate the residuals.
Discuss your results.
```{r}
checkresiduals(auto1)
```
From the ACF plot for the residuals, the residuals looks like white noise, and the residuals is approximately normally distributed. From the Ljung-Box test, the p value is 0.42. This value is larger than 0.05, so it fails to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals is white noise. 

### Question 4:
a) Calculate and plot a naïve forecast of CPI for the next 18 months.
```{r}
naive_cpi <- naive(cpi, h=18, level=c(80,95))
plot(naive_cpi)
```

b) Forecast and plot the average1 price per room (i.e., Cost) for the next 18 months using the fitted
model from Question 3 and the naïve forecast of CPI.
Discuss your results.
```{r}
f1 <- forecast(auto1, h = 18, xreg = naive_cpi$mean)
f1
plot(f1)
```

### Question 5:
a) Use the VAR() function to fit a VAR(10) model to the 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡) and 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝐶𝑃𝐼) time series. Set
the ‘type’ and ‘season’ arguments to 'both' and 12, respectively.
```{r}
library(vars)
x <- cbind(log(cost),log(cpi))
var1 <- VAR(x,p=10, type='both', season = 12)
var1
```

b) Forecast and plot the average price per room (i.e., Cost) and CPI for the next 18 months using
your fitted model.
```{r}
var_pred <- forecast(var1,h=18)
var_pred 
plot(var_pred) 
```

c) Plot the residuals’ ACF.
Discuss your results.
```{r}
plot(acf(residuals(var1)))
```
From the acf plot, we could see that there are no seasonality and trend for the residuals of VAR(10) model, and no lag is significant for the residual of VAR(10). The residuals also look like white noise for other acf plots, therefore, this means that the model capture the pattern in the data very well.
